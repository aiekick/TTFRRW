# TTFRRW
the final modest goal is to be a lightweight TrueType Font Reader Rasterizer Writer
Ok the name is terrible but for the moment not found a better name :
Designer especially for ImGuiFontStudio (for add feature like SVG import and COLR glyph) 
and also for abandon big lib like freetype and sfntly
